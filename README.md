# butterfly (1.3.0 UNOFFICIAL)

An e-AMUSEMENT server emulator.

## What is this?

This is **butterfly**, an e-AMUSEMENT server emulator. This is a mostly-fully-featured server, intended for local usage.

### Features:

* Full support for profile creation, score saving, options saving, rivals, etc.
  * Carding in works as expected, and any number of profiles is supported
* Forced full unlock (currently event progress is not tracked / everything is fully unlocked already)
* Can run on Windows/Mac/Linux

## Installation

There is no need to install butterfly. Users just need to run it, "set-and-forget" style. It runs in a terminal/command-line window and will keep doing so until the user exits it manually.

## Usage

Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/topet2k12001/butterfly/wiki) to know the detailed usage of butterfly.

## Contributing

I am but only one of the many who have forked the official source code of butterfly. For all we know, there could even be other "unofficial" builds like mine but just unpublished. I've had the chance to engage in a conversation with the original author and he is also an advocate of Open Source!

So if you want to contribute to the development of butterfly, I recommend contributing to the official source code: https://github.com/skogaby/butterfly. This will help make butterfly a better tool for everyone!

## What's next?

It depends! As long as there's new code from the official source that brings new or additional functionality I plan to continue this. My initial intention was just to get this up and running so I can play the game, but eventually I found it to be enjoyable and it's also good/additional learning on my part. Plus I get to meet new people along the way, and no less than the original author of butterfly himself!

## License

The original butterfly uses the Apache License 2.0 so I'm using the same. Please visit [this link](https://github.com/topet2k12001/butterfly/blob/master/LICENSE) to see the license in full.

Also, this version of butterfly is a fork of the [original butterfly](https://github.com/skogaby/butterfly) so moving forward I'm appending my unofficial builds with (**x.x.x UNOFFICIAL**) for 2 main reasons:

* So that it's clear to users which build of butterfly they are using
* To avoid inconvenience to the original author as people may flock to him asking for support when they may actually be using unofficial builds
